# Linux Setup

## Install Linux via Windows

### Create Bootable USB Drive
The first step is to create a bootable usb drive that you can use to install a Linux on any drive of your choosing. So far the best tool I've found to do this is [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/).

An quick tutorial using Rufus can is located on the [tutorials.ubuntu.com](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#0) site. Follow through the setup instructions and you should have a usb stick created with an Ubuntu image ready to install on another disk. 

### Install Linux on a Drive
Before you install Linux you'll want to have a drive ready without any files you want to save. Backup anything you care about because the drive will be reformatted and erased. 

Next, reboot your computer and enter the boot menu. On my computer this can be done by pressing `del` at startup, others might find it can be entered through `F8` at startup. Select the usb drive you created with Rufus as the drive you want to boot from. It should display a Ubuntu installation screen once started. 

Select `Install Ubuntu` and run through the prompts, you'll also want to select the `Erase` option while installing to allocate the full disk towards Linux. Finally, select the drive that you want to install Linux to and the installation process will start.
